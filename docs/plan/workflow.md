# Workflow Automation

As a content owner, I want to be able to define and trigger workflow automations at the project level so that I can have project-level processes that happen both automatically or manually.

* define Workflows for a Project
* define Triggers to run Workflows automatically under particular conditions
* define Schedules to run Workflows automatically at particular times
* run Workflows manually 
* view status/progress/results of Workflow Jobs
* store Job outputs as files in the project.
